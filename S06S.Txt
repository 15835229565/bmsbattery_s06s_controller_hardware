Pins connections to microcontroller

? pin 2: resistor 2200R and a capacitor to GND. This pin goes to blue wire of undocumented connector with 2 wires (blue and black(GND))
? pin 3: resistor 2200R and a capacitor to GND. Resistor 10k to VCC. This pin goes to a header pin that is not wired
? pin 10: BRAKE - through one resistor, goes to BRAKE wire
? pin 15: seems to stay always at 5V (Goes to a big diode..)
? pin 16: CURRENT SHUNT - goes to pin 7 LM358 (shunt current)
? pin 17: CURRENT PHASE B - goes to pin output of ACS711 (phase B current)
? pin 18: THROTTLE - low pass filter and goes to XS pin on the board as also to the throttle. (0.8V-3.6V input)
? pin 20: PWM pin phase A Yellow LOW. When motor very low speed, this pin is only on/off
? pin 21: PWM pin phase B Green LOW
? pin 22: PWM pin phase C Blue LOW
? pin 23: BATTERY VOLTAGE
? pin 24: seems to stay always at 2V
? pin 25: goes to a pin on the board that is unconnected (near a cable for throttle)
? pin 26: PWM pin phase C Blue HIGH
? pin 27: PWM pin phase B Green HIGH
? pin 28: PWM pin phase A Yellow HIGH
? pin 29: goes to 2nd pin on the board that is unconnected (DDB header)
? pin 30: SPEED - goes to speed sensor white wire
? pin 31: GND
? pin 32: VCC
? pin 33: NC ??
? pin 34: goes to 1st pin on the board that is unconnected (DDB header)
? pin 35: goes to unconnected pin with label RX2
? pin 36: NC ??
? pin 37: goes to a header pin and seems that is always at 5V
? pin 38: HALL SENSOR signal Blue
? pin 39: HALL SENSOR signal Green
? pin 40: HALL SENSOR signal Yellow
? pin 41: PAS - go to yellow wire of PAS connector
? pin 42: SWIM pin for flash/debug
? pin 43: connect to a pin header on the board with label T22
? pin 44: connect to a pin header on the board with label T23
? pin 45: connect to a pin header on the board with label T24
? pin 46: UART TX pin
? pin 47: UART RX pin
? pin 48: unknown, seems to always have 4.17V
